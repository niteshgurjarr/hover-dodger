# 🎯 Catch Me If You Can!

A hilarious and addictive little web challenge where the rules are simple:  
**Click the button.** That’s it. Easy, right? 😏  
Except... the button has other plans. It *dodges*, *teases*, and *taunts* you every time you get close!  

Perfect for pranking friends, testing your reflexes, or just proving you're faster than a piece of HTML.  
Can you catch it? 💥🎯
